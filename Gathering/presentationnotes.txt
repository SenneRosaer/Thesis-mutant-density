weighted average definition is not exactly the right definition
It is not really average but more a ratio
Adjusted average

code insight is fluffy be more precise
give a better example of how md can give more code insight

deeper look into literature of CC how they define it in terms of refactoring
research question is too vague

what is the use case --> sonarqube codescene hoz is it done and how do I add to this
Add demo on what can I do with this


------------------ What was good ---------------
Structure
Visualizqtion
Summary at the end
Well paces and layout
Selection of colors is nice and clear
not cluttered

Body language is very good


------------------ Improve ---------------------
Slide sometimes too empty for hoz much I talk about it --> 16 more visualization and add more structure to those to follow
Walk a bit more and wait a bit more between slides --> have a pointer maybe
Less monotonic

The problem was not extremely clear in the slides
Slide 3 is confusing on how I define the operations !!!! It should also show CC examples better visualization in parallel
It is also an extremely important slide

Support claim by experimental results

CC high and MD low is interesting
Intersection between the sets show support ofr my claim

CC below 5 is good above 5 is bad ...

What projects I apply this on
Dataset should be more clear in the presentation
It should be clear that it took a lot of work
Explain multiple and single projects in terms of the use case --> get better examples
